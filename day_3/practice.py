# 1. Write the code below that verifies the amount (length) of US States!
print()
print("Number of states in the U.S.: " + str(len(us_state)))

# 2. Create a variable called 'my_state_index' and assign it to the index of your state.

my_state_index = 4  # California

# 3. let's see if you were right.. uncomment below and run. Do you see your state?
print("My state is: " + us_state[my_state_index])

# 4.Using your state index, let's emphasize some importance to it by *upper*casing it.
us_state[my_state_index] = us_state[my_state_index].upper()
print("My capitalized state: " + us_state[my_state_index])

# 5. POOF. You've been promoted to President! Let's add a new state. I like my list to be alphabetical (which it is)
# So let's go ahead and create a state that starts with Z and append it to the end of the list.
us_state.append("Zoroabama")

# 6. There is no state that begins with B! Lets create one and insert it appropriately. (There are 3 A states.)
us_state.insert(4, "Bubbafornia")

# 7. Does anyone live in Iowa? Do you know anyone that lives there? Is it even real?! Remove it.. Do it president.
